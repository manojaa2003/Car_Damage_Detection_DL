## 📌 Project Overview

Manual vehicle damage inspection is time-consuming, subjective, and inconsistent.  
This project aims to **automate vehicle damage assessment** by leveraging **Deep Learning**, enabling faster, reliable, and scalable damage classification.

The system analyzes uploaded car images and predicts the **type and location of damage** in real time, making it highly useful for **insurance claim processing, vehicle inspection, and automotive analytics**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages**
- Python

**Libraries & Frameworks**
- PyTorch  
- torchvision  
- PIL (Pillow)  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Streamlit  

**Deep Learning Concepts**
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)  
- Transfer Learning  
- Model Fine-tuning

## 🧩 Damage Categories

The model classifies vehicle images into the following categories:

- Front_Normal  
- Front_Breakage  
- Front_Crushed  
- Rear_Normal  
- Rear_Breakage  
- Rear_Crushed  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User uploads a vehicle image via the Streamlit interface  
2. Image is preprocessed (resize, normalization, tensor conversion)  
3. Pretrained **ResNet50 CNN** extracts features  
4. Fine-tuned classifier predicts the damage category  
5. Prediction is displayed instantly on the UI
